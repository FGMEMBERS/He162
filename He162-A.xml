<!--  Heinkel 162 Salamander / Volksjaeger

      This version of the Volksjaeger tries to match the Heinkel 162-A
      as described by Captain Eric Brown, CBE, DSC, AFC, RN in :

      So its not a Supperwaffe, enabling green pilots with 10 hours
      glider practice in Hitlerjugend to win back the sky. Its not
      flying 450knots, it needs more than 500m for takeoff and its
      difficult to land.

 10.25 hours on the morning of 7 September 1945 He 162A-2 Werk-Nr 120098
    taxi by using differential brakes with nearly idle throttle nozzle A
    lift nose at: 170km/h  92knots 105mph 9500rpm nozzle S

    climb at:     346km/h 187knots 215mph 9200rpm 
[1] cruise at:    483km/h 261knots 300mph 8900rpm 5000ft
    climb to:                                     30000ft, nozzle H
    powered dive: 644km/h 347knots 400mph 8200rpm          nozzle S
[2] level at:     560km/h 302knots 348mph 9500rpm 12000ft, nozzle F
    stall at:     160km/h  86knots 100mph 3000rpm clean
[3] stall at:     140km/h  75knots  86mph 3000rpm flaps
    approach at:  200km/h 108knots 125mph 3000rpm gear, flaps, nozzle A
    touchdown at: 170km/h  92knots 105mph 3000rpm aoa 1, nozzle A
    good braking action after touchdown

[1] here my He162 is a bit faster than the flight report. I guess
    the 8900rpm of the BMW create a different thrust than the generic
    YASim jet engine.
[2] this is the configuration I used for the YASim solver. I've
    substracted 10knots because the level speed flight test was
    after testing the roll rate during a powered dive. I deceided
    against the 5000ft cruise configuration as it resulted in an
    airplane that was'nt able to reach 30000ft.
[3] this is the configuration I used for the YASim solver.

      You might claim, that Captain Eric Brown did not used a best and
      fresh engine. But I tried on an FDM with 450KTAS cruise, and it
      resulted in a plane, with a drag factor like a needle and a
      lift like a glider. It was impossible to takeoff because of the
      tendency of oscillating yaw with the result of ground rolls and
      even more impossible to land.

      Vivian and me came up with the same solution as the Heinkel team.

  " Removing some of the dihedral would have likely cured the problem,
    but with the production of the wings already underway there wasn't
    much they could do about it. Instead the wing tip droops were added
    to give the plane more vertical surface, but it wasn't enough. An
    additional attempt was made to solve the problem by adding a lead
    plug in the nose. The added weight was supposed to give the plane
    more angular inertia and damp out any oscillations, but it too seems
    to have had little effect.

    On the other hand the lead plug made the plane nose heavy. Combine
    this with the high mounted engine that wants to push the nose
    down, and you end up having serious problems trying to get off
    the ground. The 500m takeoff distance was out of the question,
    and in fact the plane needed to get over 180km/h before it could be
    lifted off. " Maury Markowitz

      The Heinkel is a joy to fly, once in the air. It has much of
      a trainer, because of the high dihedral and incidence. The
      controls are smooth but effective. This delightful little
      aeroplane spells the pleasures of the phenomenal roll rate.
      The roll rate had been best of its time, the highest outside
      the realm of hydraulically-powered ailerons. But female stalls
      and loopings and are not its strength. 

  " I pulled the He 162 into a loop. It skimmed round but I had the
    inescapable feeling that I was playing pretty close to the minimum
    speed for this particular maneuver. Finally, I tried a few stalls to
    get the feel of things before landing. As the stall was approached
    a gentle lateral lurching and some mild elevator buffet set in,
    being followed by a mild porpoising motion before the nose pitched
    down indicating stall had been reached. " Captain Eric Brown

      The main problem of the Heinkel Volksjaeger is the engine mount
      on top of the wing. This is a great problem in dogfights as its
      limiting the visibility backwards. It also makes an approach to
      land a one way shot! You need full flaps, zero throttle and a
      controlled stall to reduce speed on approach. But opening the
      throttle again, if you think you are to low or to slow will
      result in crash, as more thrust will push the nose down.
